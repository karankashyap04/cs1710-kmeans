# cs1710-kmeans
Final project for CS1710: Modeling the k-means clustering algorithm

**Note:** When we have our final demo with Tim, he mentioned that we should make sure to remind him of our desire to potentially make animations, regardless of whether or not we actually land up needing them... he said he wants to be reminded of that as a potential extension of Sterling visualizationns (through a `d3` library or something like that).
